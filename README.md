## Results

We were tasked with analyzing Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program.  The Amazon Vine program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. Companies pay a small fee to Amazon and provide products to Amazon Vine members, who are then required to publish a review.  For our project, we analyzed Vine and non-Vine review and product data from the **video games** department.

*Some review data was left out from the original dataset for our final analysis.  In an attempt to increase base review credibility, we only inlcluded review data whose reviews received 20+ votes, and whose reviews received "helpful" votes at least 50% of the time.* 

- Using bulleted lists and images of DataFrames as support, address the following questions:
Our analysis determined:
- There were 40,565 total reviews after filtering for "credible" reviews
  - 94 paid reviews (Vine)
  - 40,471 unpaid reviews
- There were 15,711 total 5-star reviews given after filtering for "credible" reviews
  - 48 5-star reviews were paid (Vine)
  - 15,663 5-star reviews were unpaid
- 51% of paid reviews were 5-star reviews (Vine)
  - 39% of unpaid reviews were 5-star reviews


## Summary

In your summary, state if there is any positivity bias for reviews in the Vine program. Use the results of your analysis to support your statement. Then, provide one additional analysis that you could do with the dataset to support your statement.
